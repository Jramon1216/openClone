# Open Clone
This project was a learning journey into FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs. It focuses on making API calls to an external service, transforming the data, and serving it to a frontend client. Through this, I gained hands-on experience integrating backend functionality with frontend applications. The project is called Open Clone because it uses api data from the OpenCritic free api.

## Technologies used
Frontend: React, vite, CSS
Backend: FastAPI
External API: [OpenCritic API](httphttps://rapidapi.com/opencritic-opencritic-default/api/opencritic-api:// "OpenCritic API")
Deployment: gh-pages(frontend), render(backend)

## Planned Features
- Caching implemention on both ends of the project
- More paths and models
- Review links for most of the games on page
